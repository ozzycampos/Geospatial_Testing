    "# Reducing the Size of a Polygon Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through the process of reducing the size of large files (csv, GeoJSON, Shapefiles) that denote polygons or lines. We will use the 'US_Census_2020_zip_code' flat relational table in the CFA data lake. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this process reduces each spatial object by removing points along the polygon that fall within a certain tolerance. This reduces resolution, but in many cases a lower resolution spatial object is acceptable for the use case and processes much faster. For instance, there are high resolution state boundary maps that contain a point at every meter. This might be necessary if working to determine if a newly-constructed fenceline crosses state boundaries, but in many other cases (such as whether a Chick-Fil-A location is in Georgia or South Carolina), a low-resolution map will suffice. Additionally, processing time and size of datasets grow exponentially with higher resolution vector data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has tools to simplify polygons, as does ArcGIS. While Alteryx works well for defining points from lat/longs, turning those points into spatial objects, building lines or polygons out of a sequence of points and then reducing them, it can be difficult to go from well-known text to polygon spatial objects. Alteryx requires a multi-step [process](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Designer-Discussions/WKT-spatial-object-read/td-p/139670) of converting this data - it's possible, but not the simplest action."

    "The Geopandas `simplify` [documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.simplify.html) function is relatively simple to use, although fine-tuning the appropriate tolerance for specific use cases can be difficult. Tolerance is in the units of the dataset, which in this case is lat/long. We want to preserve topology to avoid erroneous polygons. \n",

Note that this example has a saw-tooth boundary on the bottom left and right, which we will try to eliminate through simplification. Additionally, this polygon has 33.5k characters, which we can use as a rough baseline to see how our data is reducing. "

    "As we can see, setting a tolerance of 1 is too high - it simplified the polygon to just four points, which is much too rough for our purposes. We can see the transition of the polygon as we reduce the tolerance - at values of 1, 0.5 and 0.05, there is no difference - however, reducing the tolerance to 0.005 approximates the shape of the polygon to what might be a usable format. Further reduction to 0.0005 brings the polygon back to it's original shape. "

    "The image below is the simplified polygon, which renders much faster yet still keeps the general shape of all the polygons. In a limited test of identifying the store locations within zip codes in the state of Georgia, the simplified polygon maintained an accuracy rate of 97% versus the high resolution polygon file we started with - most errors occurred when the store was located in a sliver of land that was cut off in the simplified polygons. \n",

    "That was the technical process of reducing the size of a polygon spatial file while maintaining prominent features. However, the caveat here is whether this process is even necessary. Before conducting ETL or building a machine learning model, determine whether high resolution vector data is needed. While a civil engineer maintaining road dimensions will likely have to work with sub-meter resolution vector data and custom projections, determining distance from stores to suppliers in the unit of miles can be rendered much faster and easier using lower-resolution data. Data, such as zip code spatial file we just worked with, is offered by the Census Bureau at three different levels of [resolution](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/geographies/mapping-files.2020.List_230945507.html). If necessary, you can use the tools built here to test high and low resolution data for your use case in Python - if the low-resolution data suffices, use that. "
