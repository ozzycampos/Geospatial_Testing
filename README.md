# Geospatial_Testing
This Repository contains a series of user guides and use cases for working with geospatial data. Each script can run independently, and most of the data available is hosted on GitHub in the '01_Data' folder, with the exception of two large files that fall outside of GitHub's max size. These files (census bureau zip codes and market optimization) can be queried from the CFA Data Lake using AWS Wrangler or extracted using a SQL tool, such as DBeaver. 

The scripts are all Jupyter Notebooks, developed in an Anaconda virtual environment utilizing GDAL/Fiona/PYGEOS/Geopandas libraries.
